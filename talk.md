# Why does epistasis fail?

- Low-order/high-order plot
- High-order epistasis is common.

# Where does high-order epistasis come from?

# Build simple genotype-phenotype maps from lattice proteins

This is a simple thought experiment.

# Lattice proteins exhibit high-order epistasis.

Wait a minute! I thought lattice proteins only have interactions between two sites at a time.

# Interesting aside

Not many measurements are needed in general.

# 52 Measurements should be enough

# Complete predicted map.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Viable trajectories.

XX of XX trajectories are possible.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Conclusions

- Only a few trajectories to drug resistance are possible.
- Many neutral steps were required.
- This main explain why drug resistance took so long to evolve.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# More conclusions

- Local epistasis models are the wrong model.
- Epistasis, at this point, is our measure of uncertainty.
- Few measurements are needed to predict
- Software is great.

# Future directions

- Variational Auto encoders
- Better global models (ensemble model)

Yet to be done.
