# Proteins evolved

This is amazing.

# Evolving proteins must navigate sequence space.

# Protein evolution depends on the genotype-phenotype map.

# How do naturally evolving proteins navigate the genotype-phenotype map?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Protein led to resistance in malaria.

Introduce Malaria, CQ, and PfCRT.

Define genotype

Show empty map.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# How did Pf evolve resistance to chloroquine

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Drug resistance mechanism.

Define phenotype.

Color map.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Few trajectories are possible in PfCRT.

Show pathways.

Only XX of XX trajectories are observed. What about the rest of the map?

Appreciate the amount of work.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Can we predict phenotypes in sparsely sampled genotype-phenotype maps?

Computational tools to predict.

## Construct an additive model

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## Additive model in PfCRT.

Introduces epistasis

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

## What are the implications of epistasis?

Epistasis is important.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# How should we treat epistasis?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# First strategy: global epistasis.

cite genetics paper.
cite jakes paper.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Develop global epistasis model.

Two features that stand out.
1. Classification
2. Nonlinearity.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Global epistasis is a common feature of genotype-phenotype maps.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# What about the leftover variation?

Define local epistasis.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Local epistasis model.

Show math.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Show improvement on PfCRT data.

# Local epistasis is a common feature of genotype-phenotype maps.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Pairwise epistasis doesn't quite get us there.

Improves fit.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Add high-order epistasis

helps our fit.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# High-order epistasis is a general feature of genotype-phenotype maps.

Show bar graphs.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Let's check out local epistasis affects our predictions.

Epistasis makes our predictions worse.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# This is common to literature maps.

red/black lines for many data sets

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Where does high-order epistasis come from?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Build simple genotype-phenotype maps from lattice proteins

This is a simple thought experiment.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Lattice proteins exhibit high-order epistasis.

Wait a minute! I thought lattice proteins only have interactions between two sites at a time.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Let's examine a lattice protein over a series of mutations.

# Epistasis is a consequence of the ensemble.

# Anneliese's experiment.

# Demonstrate lac repressor

# Develop an ensemble model?

Yet to be done.
Cite Jake's paper.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# High-order epistasis does not work.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# We are stuck with global epistasis models.

However, we use epistasis as a metric for uncertainty.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Let's return to the PfCRT dataset.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# We'll try to predict the remaining map.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# How do we do?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# We estimate the uncertainty in our predictions.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# We predicted the remaining genotype-phenotype maps.

XX of XX trajectories are possible.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Conclusions

- Only a few trajectories to drug resistance are possible.
- Many neutral steps were required.
- This main explain why drug resistance took so long to evolve.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# More conclusions

- Local epistasis models are the wrong model.
- Epistasis, at this point, is our measure of uncertainty.
- Software is great.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

# Future directions

- Variational Auto encoders
- Better global models
